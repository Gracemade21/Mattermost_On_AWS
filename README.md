# Deploying Mattermost and MySQL on AWS EC2

This guide walks you through setting up a secure, self-hosted Mattermost chat application on AWS EC2. The architecture includes:

- A **public subnet** hosting the Mattermost web application.
- A **private subnet** hosting the MySQL database.
- A **NAT instance** to allow the private subnet to access the internet securely.

## üìå Prerequisites

- An active AWS account.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services (VPC, EC2, Subnets, sql database, Security Groups).
- SSH access to EC2 instances.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Overview
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4d139de-869c-4c2e-b66d-eab501617489)

The deployment consists of:

- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`.
- A public subnet (`10.0.1.0/24`) for the Mattermost server and NAT instance.
- A private subnet (`10.0.2.0/24`) for the MySQL database.
- An Internet Gateway attached to the VPC.
- Route tables configured for public and private subnets.
- Security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps

### 1. Create a VPC

- Navigate to the VPC dashboard in AWS.
- Create a new VPC with CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`.
- Enable DNS hostnames for the VPC.

### 2. Create Subnets

- **Public Subnet**:
  - CIDR block: `10.0.1.0/24`.
  - Enable auto-assign public IPv4 addresses.

- **Private Subnet**:
  - CIDR block: `10.0.2.0/24`.
  - Do not enable auto-assign public IPv4 addresses.

### 3. Set Up Internet Gateway

- Create an Internet Gateway.
- Attach it to your VPC.

### 4. Configure Route Tables

- **Public Route Table**:
  - Associate it with the public subnet.
  - Add a route: Destination `0.0.0.0/0`, Target: Internet Gateway.

- **Private Route Table**:
  - Associate it with the private subnet.
  - Add a route: Destination `0.0.0.0/0`, Target: NAT instance (to be created).

### 5. Launch EC2 Instances

- **NAT Instance**:
  - Launch in the public subnet.
  - Assign an Elastic IP.
  - Configure as a NAT instance.

- **MySQL Database Instance**:
  - Launch in the private subnet.
  - Use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AMI.

- **Mattermost Application Instance**:
  - Launch in the public subnet.
  - Use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AMI.

### 6. Install and Configure MySQL

- SSH into the MySQL instance:
  ```bash
  ssh -i MySQL.pem ubuntu@<private-IP>

- Update the system:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

- Create the MySQL installation script on EC2:
  ```bash
  vim setup-mysql.sh

- Paste the MySQL installation script on EC2:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  apt update -y
  apt install mysql-server -y

  echo "Installed MySQL"
  systemctl start mysql
  sleep 5

  echo "Configuring MySQL now"
  mysql -u root <<-EOF
  ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
  DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root' AND Host NOT IN ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1');
  DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';
  DELETE FROM mysql.db WHERE Db='test' OR Db='test_%';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  CREATE USER 'mmuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mostest';
  CREATE DATABASE mattermost_test;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mattermost_test.* TO 'mmuser'@'%'; 
  EOF

  echo "MySQL Configuration complete"
  sed -i "s/^bind-address/#bind-address/" /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

  systemctl restart mysql

- Make the script executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x setup-mysql.sh

- Run the script with sudo:
  ```bash
  sudo ./setup-mysql.sh

- Verify MySQL is running:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status mysql
